# Icon Instructions

Your PWA needs proper icon files to work correctly. The empty placeholder files we created are causing errors.

## Option 1: Use an online icon generator

1. Visit https://app-manifest.firebaseapp.com/ or https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
2. Upload a square image (at least 512x512 pixels)
3. Generate the icons
4. Download and replace the placeholder files in this directory

## Option 2: Create simple icons manually

1. Use any image editor (even MS Paint or Preview)
2. Create a 192x192 pixel image with a shopping cart or list icon
3. Save as PNG format
4. Create a 512x512 pixel version
5. Save both files in this directory

## Required files:
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-512x512.png

These files are referenced in your manifest.json and are required for PWA installation.
